# The Sticks or Chopsticks game
***Sticks***, also known as ***Chopsticks*** is a simple hand game played with two people. In the variant implemented, each player starts with 1 finger up on each hand. Both players take turns *Attacking* the other players' hands by tapping them, adding the attackers finger count to the opponents. If a hand collects 5 or more points it is considered dead. A dead hand can be "revived" by *Splitting* an even number of fingers between an alive hand and a dead hand.
