Thus, [0 0].\n  - Player 2 has both counters at 0, and Player 1 wins the game.\n\n**2. Split Moves:**\n\n- **S: B** (Split the even counter 4)\n  - After splitting, Player 1’s counters become (4/2)=2 and (4/2)=2.\n  - Game state becomes [2201].\n  \n### Best Move: \n- The best move is **A: B D**.

Attack using the 4 counter against the opponent's 1 counter, resulting in counters becoming:\n   - Player 2: (0, 0) by attacking 1, which would mean a victory as Player 2 would have both counters reset to 0.\n3.
