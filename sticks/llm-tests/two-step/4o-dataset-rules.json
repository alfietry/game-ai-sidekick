    "thinking": "In the game [3321], Player 1 has counters A = 3 and B = 3, while Player 2 has counters C = 2 and D = 1.\nTo determine the best move, let's explore each option:\n\n**Option 1: Attack using A (counter value 3):**\n- Attack C: 3 + 2 = 5 (C resets to 0)\n   - New game state: [3301] \\(\\rightarrow\\) [0133]\n   - Risky because attacking with B could reset D to 0, but Player 2 is left with one active counter, C.\n     \n- Attack D: 3 + 1 = 4\n   - New game state: [3304] \\(\\rightarrow\\) [0433]\n   - This does not immediately put Player 2 in trouble, but leaves a high counter C for a potentially strong retaliation.  \n\n**Option 2: Attack using B (counter value 3):**\n- Attack C: 3 + 2 = 5 (C resets to 0)\n   - New game state: [3301] \\(\\rightarrow\\) [0133]\n   - Similar to attacking C with A, leaving Player 2 with only one active counter.\n   \n- Attack D: 3 + 1 = 4\n   - New game state: [3344] \\(\\rightarrow\\) [0443]\n   - Again, a potentially strong retaliation for Player 2.\n  \n**Option 3: Split A or B:**\n- Since both counters A and B are 3 (non-zero and not even), splitting is not possible.\n\nConsidering the move options, attacking C with either counter A or B (incrementing C and resetting it to 0) makes the most strategic sense. This reduces Player 2's counters but retains the most potential for Player 1 to maintain offensive pressure in the next round while keeping Player 2 in a weakened state. Player 1 has the advantage of timing the Addition effect.\n\nUltimately, both attack sequences against counter C are identical, resulting in the same game state transition:\n",
    "primary_move": "A:A C",
    "primary_move_reason": "Attacking counter C with counter A reduces Player 2's capabilities by resetting one of their counters to zero, giving an advantageous positioning for Player 1 in future moves."
