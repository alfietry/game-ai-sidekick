Recall the winner being whoever meets non-zero first once their opponent hits `[0, 0]`.\n- Opting `[3320]` means opponents can **Attack A:0 D** instantly closes the match since any subsequent actions by Player 1 finish setting Player 2 toward `[0, 0]` swap completing `kill-switch`. Thus, `332 0` as `[38...],[...81] then [41 10] and `[71 40]`\n\nHence, launching `Attack with Counter 3` defeats in two more moves with effective concurrency keeping the reamining two hits indisposed fully ending near instantly eternally.
