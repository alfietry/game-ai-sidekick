    "primary_move": "A:A D",
    "primary_move_reason": "Attacking Player 2's hand D (which has only 1 unit) with hand A (3 units) converts the opponent's position into [1524] after the swap. This move strategically weakens Player 2's positioning without allowing an efficient counterattack with the few options available using hands valued above threshold. The attack limits Player 2's moves as it can trigger a potential forced play or loss in subsequent steps."

This transitions their left hand entirely out of play, giving Player 1 a potential quick path to victory.\n\nTherefore, the strategic move would involve one of the attacks to obliterate Player 2’s position most efficiently.
