Placing a '1' at (2, 3) prevents Player 2 from winning diagonally next turn.\n\n- **Column 6:**\n  - Placing a '1' in the lowest spot of column 6 adds pressure near the middle bottom row but does not immediately result in a win or block any potential threat.\n\n- **Column 4:**\n  - Filling this space with one more '1' will complete a vertical line of 1, potentially blocking Player 2 from future strategic placements.\n\nIn this situation, blocking Player 2's potential diagonal win should take priority over less immediate strategies. Hence, placing in **Column 2** should be the immediate course of action to block any vertical or diagonal advantage Player 2 might gain.",
